A project to summarize the daily news on quantum computing and deliver it to my inbox.

I would like to build an ai tool that provides me with a daily summary of news related to a specific topic.

I want the tool to provide me the summary in a format in which I can provide feedback, and I also want the summary sent to my email every day. For reference, I am using the OpenAPI framework and coding in Visual Studio
